# sudoku
A simple sudoku game. Tested on Chrome.

Install Node.js
Install dependencies:

<code>npm install</code>

Run app.js in Node and open localhost:3000 in Chrome.

For testing the result of finishing a sudoku, change line 7 of app.js to:

<code>var boards = require('./testBoards.js');</code>

Start a game on "easy" to get a sudoku with only one cell blank.

Improvements to be added:
  a big clean up.
  better variable names.
  better filenames.
  new feature: option to pause game.
  new feature: auto pause game when viewing highscores.
  better html and css code.
  Instead of displaying different div's in index.html, maybe send html-content to a single content div.
